.SH NAME
ctc2html - CTC++ to HTML Converter (v5.3)
           (CTC++, Test Coverage Analyzer for C/C++)

.SH DESCRIPTION
ctc2html converts the textual Execution Profile Listing (generated by
ctcpost or by ctcxmlmerge) into a set of hierarchical and color-coded HTML
pages. Also the actual source code is included to the report with the
execution counter information mapped to the source lines. (Source code
is not included, if it can not be found or it is denied with
-no-sources option).

ctc2html creates into current working directory subdirectory CTCHTML
(or to a directory that is specified with the -o option)
and writes the HTML pages to there. Previous pages (whose name looks like
being generated by ctc2html) are silently overwritten (or deleted if the
new set of pages is smaller). Browsing is started from
file index.html at the output directory.

ctc2html is effectively a Perl script. You need a Perl interpreter
supporting Perl 5 to run it. On Unix we assume that Perl is directly
available, but if you do not have it on your system, you can download the
latest version for example from http://www.perl.org/. (On Windows the
needed Perl comes along with the delivery package.)

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.BR -i " inputfile"
.RS
Specifies the input file name. This file must be a CTC++ Execution
Profile Listing produced by ctcpost or by ctcxmlmerge. If this option
is omitted, ctc2html reads stdin.
.RE
.PP
.BR -t " threshold"
.RS
Sets the threshold percent, which is 100 by default. Has effect on
reporting the TER (Test Effectiveness Ratio percent) on various summary
levels. If the obtained TER is lower than the given limit, it is
highlighted with red color.
.RE
.PP
.BR -s " source-dir"
.RS
Specifies additional directories where the source files are looked for.
Normally this option is not needed, i.e. the source files can be found with
the name how they are shown at the input Execution Profile Listing. That
gets determined at instrumentation time by the SOURCE_IDENTIFICATION
configuration setting (one of as_given, basename, absolute,
absolute_without_drive).

Many -s options can be given. If a source file is not found with the name
as it is shown at the input Execution Profile Listing, it is tried to be found
by catenating the soure file name (with path part) to the directory names
of -s options. If the source file is still unfound, the source file name is
stripped-off from its path part, and it is tried to be found from the
directories given in the -s option. If after all these attempts to find the
source file, it is still unfound, the HTML page for the source file is
generated solely based on the input Execution Profile Listing information.
.RE
.PP
.BR -o " output-dir"
.RS
Specifies the directory, which will be created (if needed), and where the
HTML files will be written to. If this option is not given, the default is
CTCHTML subdirectory of current directory.
.RE
.PP
.B -nsb
.RS
Tell to ctc2html not to start browsing automatically.
(Automatic starting of the browser is supported only on Windows.)
.RE
.PP
.B -h 
.RS
Prints a brief description of the command-line options.
.RE
.PP
.B --enable-help 
.RS
Prints a brief description of the --enable-XXX options.
.RE

Examples:
.RS
.B  ctc2html -i profile.txt -s ../sources -t 75
.RE
.RS
.B  ctc2html < profile.txt
.RE
.RS
.B  ctcpost -p - | ctc2html
.RE

You are supposed to start the browsing by default from 
file ./CTCHTML/index.html.

.SH FILES
CTCHTML
.RS
When -o option is not given, this subdirectory is created into the working
directory and  the output files are written there.
.RE

.SH NOTES
If you have made changes to your source files since the last time
you instrumented them, the profile listing will be out of date.
If you now generate the HTML report again, the line number etc. mapping
to the source code is most likely wrong.
